**Questions that might be asked later**

Q: Can you remove the slight pause before dismantling items or between other movements?

Q: Can you make the mouse movements any faster?
A: As said prior, for certain movements, no, for others, yes.

Q: Is this code perfect?
A: Absolutely not, and if you think parts of it can be written better, PLEASE let me know, it makes everything better.

Q: Will this farm last forever?
A: Doubt it.

Q: Can you make a script that sends you to Spider and buys more glimmer?
